# Vulnerability Management Policy: CheckTick

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Reviewed by SIRO:** 29/11/2025
**Approval Status:** Approved

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines how CheckTick identifies, assesses, and remediates security vulnerabilities within our software stack and infrastructure to protect health and care data.

## 2. Software Stack Monitoring

CheckTick utilizes a modern Python/Django stack. We monitor for vulnerabilities at three levels:

* **Application Code:** Manual code reviews and automated linting, full test suite.
* **Dependencies:** Monitoring of Python packages (PyPI) and JavaScript libraries.
* **Infrastructure:** Monitoring of Northflank container images and base OS layers.

## 3. Automated Detection (GitHub Dependabot)

We utilize **GitHub Dependabot** to provide 24/7 monitoring of our repository dependencies, `pip audit` and `GitGuardian`.

* **Alerting:** Security alerts are sent immediately to both founding partners.
* **Automation:** Dependabot is configured to automatically generate Pull Requests for known security fixes.
* **Review:** No security patch is merged without passing our automated CI/CD test suite to ensure system stability.

## 4. Remediation Timelines

Vulnerabilities are triaged based on their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score:

| Severity | Definition | Target Remediation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | Immediate risk of data breach or system takeover. | Within 48 hours |
| **High** | Significant risk to data or system availability. | Within 7 days |
| **Medium/Low** | Minimal risk, often requiring complex local access. | Next scheduled release |

## 5. Patch Management Process

1. **Identification:** Alert received via Dependabot or Northflank Security Scan.
2. **Assessment:** The CTO [Simon Chapman] assesses the impact on our specific environment.
3. **Testing:** Patches are applied in a staging environment and verified against our test suite.
4. **Deployment:** Successful patches are deployed to production via our automated Northflank pipeline.
5. **Verification:** Production logs are monitored to ensure the fix is active and stable.

## 6. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

In the event of a high-profile "Zero-Day" (e.g., Log4Shell style events), the CTO will initiate an emergency review of all infrastructure components within 24 hours, regardless of whether an automated alert has been triggered.
