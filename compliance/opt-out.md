# National Data Opt-Out

CheckTick is a platform provider. Compliance with the National Data Opt-Out is the responsibility of our customers (the Data Controllers). However, our platform provides the technical capability for Controllers to remove specific records if a patient exercises their right to opt-out via the national service.
